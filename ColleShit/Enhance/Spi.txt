@madsley, there is no clash with SPI, Teensy 3 SPI pins = 10,11,12,13 (although there is more than one option for SPI), and OCtows2811 was designed to avoid this issue by using pins:
2 LED Strip #1
14 LED Strip #2
7 LED Strip #3
8 LED Strip #4
6 LED Strip #5
20 LED Strip #6
21 LED Strip #7
5 LED Strip #8
15 & 16 Connect together
4 Do not use
3 Do not use as PWM
12 Frame Sync (Video)
For the CC3000, the IRQ and VBEN can be reassigned. I'm not in front of my sketch right now, but I think they went to pin1 and pin9, and declared as such in the sketch. I have not used the WIZ820, but its only SPI and v and gnd, so again, wont be any conflicts.


You can double the speed of the SPI bus from 12MHz to 24MHz by un-commenting this line...

// SPIFIFO.begin(W5200_SS_PIN, SPI_CLOCK_24MHz); // W5200 is 33 MHz max
â€¦ in the Ethernet library in utility/w5100.cpp.
