So in NeoPixel the limit should also be around 10 000 rgb leds or 7700 rgbw leds for 256K RAM.
Wiij hebben 4 keer zoveel ram

Number of LEDs is binary truncated to uint16_t. You can't specify more than 65535. That's what Frank was trying to tell you, in msg #2.

the strand tests also can not drive over 110 LEDs, it seems to me that the problem is in the Adafruit_NeoPixel.h> driver
