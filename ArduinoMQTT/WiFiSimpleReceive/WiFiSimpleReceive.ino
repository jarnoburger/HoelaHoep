  ArduinoMqttClient - WiFi Simple Receive

  This example connects to a MQTT broker and subscribes to a single topic.
  When a message is received it prints the message to the serial monitor.

  The circuit:
  - Arduino MKR 1000, MKR 1010 or Uno WiFi Rev.2 board

  This example code is in the public domain.
